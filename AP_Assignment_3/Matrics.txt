There are ~15 types of Matrices:
1. Rectangular Matrix
2. Row Matrix
3. Column Matrix
4. Square Matrix
5. Symmetric Matrix
6. Skew-symmetric Matrix
7. Upper-triangular Matrix
8. Lower-triangular Matrix
9. Singular Matrix
10. Diagonal Matrix
11. Scalar Matrix
12. Identity Matrix
13. Singleton Matrix
14. Ones Matrix
15. Null Matrix

Functionality
1. Take matrices as input and label them with appropriate matrix-types.
2. Create matrices of requested matrix-types and label them with appropriate matrix-types.
3. Change the elements of a matrix as long as the fixed matrix-type labels remain valid.
4. Display all the matrix-type labels of a requested matrix.
5. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication & division.
6. Perform element-wise operations.
7. Transpose matrices.
8. Inverse matrices.
9. Compute means: row-wise mean, column-wise mean, mean of all the elements.
10. Compute determinants.
11. Use singleton matrices as scalars, if requested.
12. Compute A+AT for a matrix A.
13. Compute Eigen vectors and values.
14. Solve sets of linear equations using matrices.
15. Retrieve all the existing matrices (entered or created) having requested matrix-type labels.
